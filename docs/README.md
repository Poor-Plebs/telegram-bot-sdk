# Docs Memory System

This folder is a long-term memory for agent and human sessions.

Use it to capture meaningful work that should be easy to continue later:

- Major features implemented
- Investigations, spikes, and debugging work
- Architectural decisions and tradeoffs
- Migration notes and follow-up tasks

## File Naming Convention

Every memory file must be Markdown and follow:

`yyyy-mm-dd_[descriptive-file-name].md`

Examples:

- `2026-02-02_telegram-client-extraction.md`
- `2026-02-05_retry-middleware-investigation.md`

## Writing Guidelines

- Keep one clear topic per file
- Start with scope/context, then what was done, then outcomes
- Include open questions and concrete next steps
- Prefer concise, scannable bullets

## Goal

A folder listing should make it obvious what was done and when, so future sessions can pick up work quickly.
